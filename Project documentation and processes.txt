PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
PROJECT INTRODUCTION
About the Project
AidRyse is a platform for accessing audio information about Gender-Based Violence (GBV). This project is built by team Herhive in collaboration with South Saharan Social Development Organization (SSDO). It focuses on a section of their many projects (Gender-based violence). AidRyse aims to present help to victims of GBV and people who want to share their experiences to encourage and educate others. The audio web application will provide content in the three major Nigerian languages: Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, and of course in English.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

PROJECT SCOPE
AidRyse will provide a platform for accessing audio information about Gender-Based Violence (GBV) for victims and for people that need access to this information.

ABOUT THE NGO WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH
South Saharan Social Development Organization (SSDO) is a duly registered non-profit organization in Nigeria, with a primary focus of equipping women, youth and children with the social, health, economic, educational and political skills needed to survive and compete favorably in a vastly changing and urbanizing Sub-Saharan Africa.

PROJECTS AREAS OF SOUTH SAHARAN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION:
•	Health
•	Education
•	Good governance
•	Livelihood
•	Gender

OUR PROJECT KEY FOCUS
Gender: Gender-Based Domestic Violence
The Sister Guardian Initiative (SGI) is an SSDO-funded project that institutes community structures called SGI Chapters with a mandate to provide survivor-centered care to Violence against Women (VAW) victims while advocating for institutional deterrence against the practice in Southeastern Nigeria.
These set of women are trained to provide a range of services to female victims of violence. The services include counseling, conflict resolution and mediation, provision of safe houses, and referrals to health and law enforcement agencies. They also routinely engage in community sensitization on VAW and community-based advocacy aimed at effecting the institutionalization of local policies and bye laws to deter acts of VAW.
INSIGHTS
We noticed that this project initiative does not cover male victims. On inquiry, the NGO explained that statistically, there are more female victims of GBV than there are male victims. So, we decided to create AidRyse with a focus on both male and female victims. Therefore, we will be providing information and solutions that would benefit both male and female victims in an audio format.

COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS
•	Google meet (for all meetings)
•	WhatsApp (group chat)


PROJECT PROCESS

First Meeting (10th October 2022)
We had a meeting after the orientation for the Hackfest and we discussed the project and made sure each member of the team understood the project.
Agenda
•	To map out a strategy or plan
•	To get an NGO that will assist us in our project

WhatsApp Discussion 
We got a consultant that would link us to an NGO that we would be collaborating with. The next step was to set up a meeting with the consultant. 

Second Meeting (11th October 2022)
We had a meeting with the consultant, Mr. Wilfred who promised to link us with an NGO that we can work with. 
Agenda of the meeting with Mr. Wilfred
•	To figure out an area that we want to focus on, so that it can help us in the search for an NGO to work with.
The meeting continued after Mr. Wilfred had left the meeting

Outcome
•	We decided to focus on an NGO that advocates for Down Syndrome patients or Sickle Cell Anemia patients

Slack and WhatsApp conversation
Emmanuella reached out to Omotola, the She Code Africa community manager, who directed her to a consultant who in turn connected her with an NGO that focuses on Sickle Cell Anemia patients. Unfortunately, the NGO was not disposed to provide help at that time.

Key milestones so far
•	The completion of the UI design after few iterations
•	Aidryse logo and color guide
•	Creation of a GitHub repository

Third Meeting (13th October 2022)
We had a meeting with Mr. Wilfred and Mr. Udochukwu Egwim, the head of programs at South Saharan Social Development Organization (SSDO). Unfortunately, the projects that the NGO focuses on did not include advocacy for Down Syndrome patients or Sickle Cell Anemia patients.
Agenda

The meeting continued after Mr. Wilfred and Mr. Udochukwu left the Google meet call.
Outcome

Our Experience 
This was our first experience working with an NGO, a team, mentors, and the open source community. Working together on the project gave us a chance not only to understand but to learn more about gender based violence. The experience for each of us was fun and also a good one especially the fact that we always carried each other along and the team work was top notch.Despite some challenges we had, we all thought this was a great learning process that we had ever had in our lives.

Lessons learnt
The lessons we learned from this hackfest range from being able to collaborate with people from various tech fields who have varying knowledge of technologies, to being able to work with time, learning more ways to use github other than pushing codes and cloning a repo, learning new technologies and working with them, and being able to think effectively and efficiently.

Things we improved on
Time management: this was much needed in our project due to the time restrictions and our busy schedules since all of us are all students preparing for exam.
Teamwork: although teamwork came easily for us all but we all could admit that it was one of the things that improved for us.
Organisation: this helped us become more productive, focused and efficient on our project.
