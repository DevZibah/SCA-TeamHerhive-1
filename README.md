# Aidryse

Aidryse is a web-based platform for accessing audio information on Gender Based Domestic Violence. This project is in collaboration with South Sahara Social Development Organization (SSDO). This project only focused on a section of their many projects. Aidryse also offers a form of help to victims and creates an avenue for people to share their experiences in other to help or enlighten others. The audio web application will also come in three different languages which are Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo including English.

Aidryse is based on the open source reactjs javascript library, and more specifically on its realease 17.0.2. This version includes the main functionality needed for [aidryse.netlify.app](https://aidryse.netlify.app/)
