# Aidryse

Aidryse is a web-based platform for accessing audio information on Gender Based Violence. In collaboration with South Sahara Social Development Organization (SSDO), we only focused on a section of their many projects. Understanding that GBV has become a prevalent social ill, we decided to create a platform that educates and shares stories of Gender-based violence in audio format.

Victims, witnesses or anyone seeking information on Gender Base Violence, can visit our website [Aidryse](https://aidryse.netlify.app/) and listen to educative contents and stories, in their preferred languages but limited to Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo including English. AidRyse was built for the underrepresented minority in the society. We understand that not everyone is yet literate and so we have made the audio information available in the major Nigerian local languages. This, we believe, will facilitate information dissemination.
