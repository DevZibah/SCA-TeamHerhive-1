# Aidryse

Aidryse is a web-based platform for accessing audio information on Gender Based Violence. In collaboration with South Sahara Social Development Organization (SSDO), we only focused on a section of their many projects.

Victims, witnesses or anyone seeking information on Gender Base Violence, can visit our website and listen to educative contents and stories, in their preferred language but limited to Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo including English.

Aidryse is based on the open source reactjs javascript library, and more specifically on its realease 17.0.2. This version includes the main functionality needed for [aidryse.netlify.app](https://aidryse.netlify.app/)
